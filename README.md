# Cubing-in-WPF-under-.NET-6

A C# project using WPF 3D technology to simulate a NxNxN cube.
It can found the solution using Daniel Walton's rubiks-cube-NxNxN-solver python code.
It has been optimized for cpu usage of 6% when animating .

If you want to run the code, please do some adaptive modifactions first. Daniel Walton's rubiks-cube-NxNxN-solver python code will not run under Windows, you must follow my tips of the issue discussion.
